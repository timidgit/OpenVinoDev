# Enhanced Qwen3 OpenVINO GenAI - New Features

## 🎯 Dynamic System Prompt Configuration

The application now includes an interactive system prompt editor that allows you to:

- **Modify AI behavior in real-time**: Change the assistant's persona, expertise, and response style
- **Reset to defaults**: Quickly restore the original optimized prompt
- **Apply changes instantly**: Changes take effect immediately when you clear the chat

### How to Use:
1. Expand the "🎯 System Prompt Configuration" accordion
2. Edit the system prompt in the text area
3. Click "✅ Apply & Clear Chat" to activate your changes
4. Use "🔄 Reset to Default" to restore original settings

## 📚 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

Upload your own documents to provide the AI with specific context for more accurate, grounded responses.

### Supported File Types:
- Text files (`.txt`)
- Markdown (`.md`) 
- Code files (`.py`, `.js`, `.html`, `.css`, `.json`)

### How to Use:
1. Expand the "📚 Document Upload (RAG)" accordion
2. Upload one or more text-based files
3. Wait for processing confirmation
4. Ask questions about your uploaded content
5. The AI will reference your documents when relevant

### RAG Features:
- **Automatic context retrieval**: Finds relevant sections from your documents
- **Source attribution**: Shows which document information came from
- **Multiple document support**: Upload and query multiple files simultaneously
- **Smart chunking**: Optimally splits documents for better retrieval
- **Fallback behavior**: Works normally if no relevant context is found

## 📊 Enhanced Interface

### New Components:
- **System Prompt Editor**: Configure AI behavior
- **File Upload Panel**: Add documents for RAG
- **Upload Status Display**: Monitor document processing
- **RAG Status Button**: Check document processing statistics
- **Clear Documents**: Remove all uploaded content

### Professional Improvements:
- **Organized accordions**: Collapsible sections for clean interface
- **Contextual help**: Tooltips and guidance text
- **Error handling**: Graceful fallbacks when dependencies are missing
- **Status feedback**: Real-time updates on system operations

## 🔧 Installation Requirements

### Core Dependencies (Already Included):
```bash
pip install openvino-genai>=2024.4.0 gradio>=4.0.0 transformers>=4.30.0
```

### RAG Dependencies (New):
```bash
pip install langchain faiss-cpu sentence-transformers
```

If RAG dependencies aren't installed, the system will work normally but without document processing capabilities.

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### System Prompt Customization:
```
You are a specialized Python coding assistant with expertise in machine learning and data science. 

Key behaviors:
- Provide complete, working code examples
- Explain complex algorithms step-by-step
- Focus on best practices and optimization
- Include relevant imports and dependencies
```

### RAG-Enhanced Queries:
After uploading technical documentation:
- "What does the uploaded document say about model optimization?"
- "Summarize the key configuration options from the files"
- "How should I implement the feature described in the documentation?"

## 🏗️ Project Structure Changes

### New Archive Structure:
```
OpenVinoDev/
├── gradio_qwen_enhanced.py  # ← Main application (enhanced)
├── archive/                 # ← Legacy files moved here
│   ├── gradio_qwen_debug.py

└── requirements.txt         # ← Updated with RAG dependencies
```

## 🔒 Security & Performance

### Security Features:
- **Input validation**: Sanitizes uploaded files and user input
- **File type restrictions**: Only allows safe text-based formats
- **Memory management**: Efficient document chunking and storage
- **Graceful fallbacks**: System works even if RAG fails

### Performance Optimizations:
- **Lightweight embeddings**: Fast sentence-transformers model
- **Smart chunking**: Optimized for retrieval accuracy
- **Context caching**: FAISS vector store for fast similarity search
- **NPU compatibility**: RAG processing runs on CPU while inference uses NPU
