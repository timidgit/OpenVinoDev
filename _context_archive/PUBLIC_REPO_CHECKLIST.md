MODEL_PATH = r"C:\OpenVinoModels\qwen3-8b-int4-cw-ov"
CACHE_DIR = r"C:\temp\.ovcache_qwen3_enhanced"

# AFTER (environment-based)
MODEL_PATH = os.getenv("QWEN3_MODEL_PATH", "./models/qwen3-8b-int4-cw-ov")
CACHE_DIR = os.getenv("CACHE_DIR", "./cache/.ovcache_qwen3_enhanced")
```

### 2. Copyright Attribution
